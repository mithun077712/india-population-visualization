Project Overview
This Python script visualizes India's historical population and population density trends using a CSV dataset. It provides various bar and line charts for exploratory analysis.

Features
Reads historical population and density data from a CSV file.​

Plots population growth and density trends over time using Matplotlib.​

Handles both "Population" and "Density" columns dynamically.​

Distinct visualizations for population, density, and combined analysis.​

Requirements
Python 3.x

pandas

matplotlib

Install the required libraries via pip:

bash
pip install pandas matplotlib
Dataset
The script expects a CSV file named C1.1 - IndiaHistoricalPopulationDensityData.csv with columns for year, population, and density.​

Usage
Place the CSV data file in your working directory.

Run the script:

bash
python skillcraft1.py
The script will generate multiple charts displaying:

Population growth over years

Population density changes

Combined analysis (bar + line plots on dual axes)​

Output
The script displays visualizations directly using Matplotlib pop-up windows for immediate viewing.​

Example
No sample dataset is included—add your own or use any historical India population/density CSV with year columns.​
